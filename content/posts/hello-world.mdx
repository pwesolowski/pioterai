# Hello World

![Hello World Hero](/images/blog/hello-world-hero.png)

I've been a software engineer for years, but the recent explosion in AI has convinced me that it's time to learn something new.

## Why AI?

It's not just about the hype. It's about the potential to build tools that were impossible just a few years ago.

## What to expect

I'll be documenting my learning process, sharing code snippets, and building real projects.

```javascript
console.log("Hello, AI!");
```

Stay tuned!
