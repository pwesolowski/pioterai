# Starting My YouTube Channel: The Tech Stack & Learning Path

I've decided to start a YouTube channel to document my journey and share what I'm learning. It's a big step, and like any engineering project, it requires some initial planning and the right set of tools.

Here is my roadmap for getting started, the tools I'm choosing, and the skills I need to learn.

## 1. Generating an Intro with AI

I want the channel to have a professional feel right from the start, and a custom intro is a great way to do that. Instead of hiring a motion designer, I'm going to explore the latest AI video generation tools.

**Tools I'm exploring:**

*   **Runway Gen-2 / Gen-3**: Known for high-quality text-to-video generation. I can describe the vibe I want (e.g., "futuristic, clean, tech-focused") and see what it produces.
*   **Pika Labs**: Great for animating existing images or creating short clips from text.
*   **Luma Dream Machine**: A newer contender that's showing impressive results for realistic motion.

**The Goal:** Create a short, 3-5 second intro sequence that establishes my brand identity without spending weeks on After Effects.

## 2. Documenting Content with NotebookLM

To keep my ideas, scripts, and research organized, I'm setting up a personal knowledge base using **Google's NotebookLM**.

**Why NotebookLM?**
It allows me to upload all my source materials—PDFs, Google Docs, notes—and then "chat" with them. I can ask it to summarize my research, suggest video outlines based on my notes, or even generate a podcast-style discussion to help me brainstorm.

**My Workflow:**
1.  Dump raw ideas and research links into a source document.
2.  Use NotebookLM to structure that into a video script.
3.  Keep a "Series Bible" to maintain consistency across videos.

## 3. Recording with the DJI Action

For camera gear, I'm using the **DJI Action**. It's compact, has great stabilization, and is perfect for desk shots or "vlog" style updates.

**Key Challenge: Blurring Sensitive Info**
Since I'll be showing my screen and potentially real-world environments, I need to master blurring in post-production.
*   **Technique**: Tracking blur in DaVinci Resolve.
*   **Goal**: Automatically track and blur screens, faces, or documents that shouldn't be public.

## 4. Screen Recording Workflow

A lot of my content will be coding or software demos, so high-quality screen recording is non-negotiable.

**Requirements:**
*   Crisp 4K resolution (if possible) to allow for zooming in during editing.
*   Clean audio capture (system sound + microphone).
*   **OBS Studio** is the likely candidate here for its flexibility, but I'm also looking at simpler tools like **CleanShot X** (Mac) for quick captures.

## 5. Editing in DaVinci Resolve

This is the biggest learning curve. I've chosen **DaVinci Resolve** because the free version is incredibly powerful.

**Skills I need to master:**

### Face vs. Screen Switching
I want to seamlessly transition between my talking head and the screen share.
*   **Dynamic Zoom**: Using smooth zooms to focus the viewer's attention.
*   **Cutaways**: Timing the switch to keep the pacing energetic.

### "Avatar in Corner" (Picture-in-Picture)
For tutorials, I need a clean "gamer style" facecam in the corner.
*   **Circle Crop**: Making the camera feed circular for a modern look.
*   **Borders & Shadows**: Adding a subtle border to separate me from the code.

### Animations & Polish
*   **Text Overlays**: Simple, clean lower-thirds to introduce topics.
*   **Transitions**: Moving beyond simple cuts to keep the visual flow interesting (without overdoing it).

## 6. Audio Setup: Thronmax vs. Apple

Good audio is arguably more important than good video. I currently have two options to test:
*   **Thronmax Camera Mic**: A dedicated USB microphone often has better depth.
*   **Apple Pro Headphones**: Great for noise isolation, but sometimes the Bluetooth compression can sound "thin."

**The Plan:** Record a sample paragraph with both and listen back with eyes closed. Whichever sounds more "present" and less echoey wins.

## 7. Thumbnails: The Click Magnet

I know that even the best video won't get views if the thumbnail is boring.
*   **Strategy**: High contrast, readable text (max 3-4 words), and an expressive face or intriguing visual.
*   **Tools**: I'll use **Canva** for layout and potentially **Midjourney** or **DALL-E 3** to generate interesting background elements if I don't have a good photo.

## 8. Lighting & SEO

### Lighting
I'm keeping it simple. A good key light (or even a window) at a 45-degree angle is usually enough. The goal is to separate myself from the background so the image doesn't look flat.

### SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
Before I even hit record, I need to know what people are searching for.
*   **Keywords**: I'll research terms like "AI coding tools," "Next.js tutorial," or "dev vlog" to see what's trending.
*   **Titles**: I'll draft 3-5 title variations to see which one is the most compelling.

I'll be sharing my progress on all of these as I go. Stay tuned!
